# Introduction to My Managerial Approach
> I encourage collaboration through pull requests and issues. If you notice any differences in how I work compared to what's outlined here, I'm open to your insights.

If you're reading this, you might be working with me, interested in collaborating, or simply curious about my managerial style. While many of the points covered below often come up naturally in our initial interactions, this document aims to provide an additional layer of understanding about how I can support you effectively.

## Greetings, I'm Jonathan, a Multifaceted Manager
If we've interacted for more than a few minutes within a professional context, you've likely noticed that I juggle various responsibilities. My primary role involves leading go-to-market efforts for the company, but I also engage in diverse tasks to foster growth for both myself, the company, and our team. These tasks range from recruitment to strategy and product-related activities. Feel free to inquire about my current undertakings if you're curious; I'm more than willing to share.

That said, my main focus (and the purpose behind this document) is to ensure your success. I firmly believe that success derives from personal and professional fulfillment. I am committed to supporting your growth as an individual, an employee, and a valuable member of our company.

Supporting your growth can take various forms. Whether it's code reviews, reviewing reports, or offering insights on your performance as an employee, I'm dedicated to providing constructive feedback that aids in your development.

## Open Dialogue and Feedback
Your feedback is incredibly valuable to me, and I'm eager to receive it. I believe in maintaining an environment of open communication. I prefer candid conversations over sugar-coating or evasiveness. If there are ways I can enhance my approach, please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.

While I appreciate face-to-face feedback, I'm also open to receiving it through email or Slack if that suits you better. If you're not comfortable sharing your feedback directly with me, you can discuss it anonymously with my co-founder, who will ensure I receive it.

In return, I'll be equally direct with my feedback for you. Whether there are areas for improvement or commendable efforts on your part, I'll communicate openly. During our initial one-on-one meeting, I'll inquire about your preferences regarding feedback frequency and delivery methods. I'll strive to respect and adhere to your preferences.

## Communication and Availability
My schedule tends to be quite busy, often involving several meetings. However, I'm always available to you when you need assistance. While I manage my calendar carefully, scheduling time with me is the most reliable way to connect. If you have a quick question, feel free to ask. Typically, email or Slack are the most efficient channels to reach me. Nevertheless, if you'd prefer an in-person discussion, don't hesitate to approach me at my desk. If I don't respond immediately, please give me a moment as I might be wrapping up my current task to give you my full attention.

Though I generally prefer Slack or email for more involved discussions (especially if I'm focused on pressing matters), I'm open to shorter conversations as well. I'm also always up for coffee chats or short walks outdoors. Feel free to schedule these on my calendar if they align with your needs.

While I do tend to work longer hours, I don't expect you to match my exact schedule. I strongly believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance. As long as you complete the tasks we've agreed upon during the week, I'm content. Occasionally, I'll arrange meetings, and your attendance is appreciated. If you can't make a meeting, please inform me in advance. Above all, exercise good judgment.

## Performance and One-on-One Meetings
We'll likely have regular weekly one-on-one meetings. I'd prefer to schedule these at a time that suits you best. Your one-on-one time is yours to utilize, and while I may have specific topics to cover, feel free to use this time according to your needs.

While one-on-ones are excellent for discussing matters that aren't suitable for broader conversations, don't feel restricted to those topics alone. Our one-on-one sessions are designed to aid your happiness and growth. Everything discussed will remain confidential unless you request otherwise or unless it pertains to specific subjects outlined in our employee handbook. If you're facing obstacles or concerns, I'm here to listen during these meetings. If you're curious about a topic, we can delve into it. We'll also have regular team meetings to recap events, so there's no need to cover every detail of the week unless you wish to highlight specific points.

Above all, please remember that my intention is to provide support and assistance whenever you need it. Your success is my priority.
